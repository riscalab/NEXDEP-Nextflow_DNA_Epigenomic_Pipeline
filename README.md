# NEXDEP-Nextflow_DNA_Epigenomic_Pipeline
Welcome to NEXDEP our Nextflow DNA Epigenomic Pipeline. You can take your DNA based reads from fastq files to bam files. This pipeline will also include processes and workflows for any DNA data that is created from ChIP-seq, Cut&amp;Run, Cut&amp;Tag, ATAC-seq and more assays that rely on some form of peak calling downstream.
