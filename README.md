# NEXDEP-Nextflow_DNA_Epigenomic_Pipeline
Welcome to NEXDEP our Nextflow DNA Epigenomic Pipeline. You can take your DNA based reads from fastq files to bam files. This pipeline will also include processes and workflows for any DNA data that is created from ChIP-seq, Cut&amp;Run, Cut&amp;Tag, ATAC-seq and more assays that rely on some form of peak calling downstream. 
##This is the pipeline so far, it will take your dna based reads and preprocess them from the fastq to bam level. The pipeline handles ATAC data and shifts the genomic coordinates in preprocessing. There are many parameters so read through them and choose the best one that works for your project. This pipeline so far includes workflows specific for hera's project with NASA data, so those parameters will only be used for that project. I will add workflows that will take the dna based bam files and call peaks and other normal downstream analysis methods for this type of data. MORE COMMING SOON
